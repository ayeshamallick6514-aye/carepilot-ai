CarePilot AI is an explainable HealthTech decision-support system that provides
personalized health guidance based on user-provided health vitals.

This project focuses on **AI system design**, safety, and explainability rather
than just training a single machine learning model.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Most health-related AI systems either:
- provide generic advice without confidence, or
- act as black boxes without explanations.

CarePilot AI addresses this by generating **confidence-aware, explainable**
health guidance using patient vitals and grounded medical knowledge.
